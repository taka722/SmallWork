If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

According to the result, those songs basically have high score about average energy, danceability, valence.
This suggests an audio aura that could be characterized as "Vibrant" or "Exuberant."
The listener whose top songs are characterized by these traits might be someone who enjoys lively and spirited music that energizes and uplifts.


Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

I think the results may not fully capture the nuanced emotional responses that different songs can evoke in the listener.
For example:
The calculations does not containt the listener's personal experiences or memories associated with the songs,
which could significantly influence how the music is perceived.
And also this result does not contain the Music diversity : People often listen to a variety of music that suits different moods and activities,
and Emotional Connection: Emotional responses to music are highly personal and can be influenced by lyrics, memories associated with the song, or even external factors such as the opinions of friends and family.
These nuances are not captured by quantitative metrics like danceability, energy, and valence, and Cultural and Language Factors: The aura calculation may overlook cultural significance and language.
Songs in a listener's non-native language may be enjoyed differently compared to songs in their native language.

There are several ways for aura calculations.
For example, Lyric analysis: I guess people also care about the meaning of the lyrics,
and it is important for aura cluculations to understand the lyrics and emotional tone.
Culutural sensitivity :  Take into account the cultural significance of the music,
which could be factored into how songs are weighted in the aura calculation.
