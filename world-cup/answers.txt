Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: TODO
I feel 10 simulations provide incorrect predictions.
That is because whne I did 10 simulations, Belgium had a 40 percent cahnce of winning and Denmark had 20 percent chance.
However, when i increased the number of simulations, Belgium's chanve of winning became 21.2 percent and Denmark's chance became 3.2 percent.
This result provided that low number of simulations can give wrong predictions for chance of winning.


Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: TODO
I guess 100000 simulations are enough number for predictions. That is because my predictions started to stabilize arount 100000 simulations,
and there is little changes the predictions from 100000 to 1000000 simulations.
So, I feel 100000 simulations might be good enogh for predictions.
